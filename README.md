## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM

### What I learned

I used CSS Grid to layout the two dimentional content as per the video tuitorials I've been following on Frontend Mentor. For one dimentional content and to easily center content I used Flexbox.

### Continued development

I signed up for [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com) and am following the CSS learning path.

### Useful resources

- [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com) - following the CSS learning path has helped me get a grip on the basics of CSS.

- [SVG Viewport and viewBox (For Complete Beginners)](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/svg-viewport-and-viewbox-for-beginners--cms-30844t) - helped me to get a handle on working with SVG.
